            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Justin Scholtz and this is my story. I've been introduced to computers at a young age and because of that it made me realise where my passion lays. I was privilege enough to have a computer filled with games and I would be spending hours playing these games, there were times when those games used to crash which also left me so sad but luckily for me I had a older brother who was also into computers and knew where to search for solutions, I would watch him countless times try to fix those bugs and in doing so made me wanted to do it myself and that lead me to world wide web. www.google.com - how to fix error 123FFCc - spend countless hours trying to fix this error - 5 hours later the game opens and I get this amazing feeling like "wow I actually did that?!", this was the start for my love for Information Technology but it would be a very long and challenging road for me. I wasn't the smartest kid in school, never had the highest marks ever which meant I couldn't do IT in high school but was lucker enough to come across a college called iStudent Academy which gave me the chance to study IT which I enjoyed so much. I was introduced to different aspects of IT but the one that stood out for me was web development, which is the reason I'm creating this website. I'm still learning the ropes of web development but I hope an opportunity to work as a web developer comes my way as I feel like I'm ready to grab it with both my arms! Thank you for reading my story. </p>
